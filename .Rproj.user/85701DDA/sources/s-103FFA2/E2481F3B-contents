## WARNING: DUE TO AN OLD VERSION OF RSTUDIO SERVER, PYTHON AND R CODE CHUNKS DO NOT INTERACT ON THE EDUCCOMP SERVERS. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD STILL KNIT CORRECTLY (i.e., YOU SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO USE `r.obj_from_r` and `py$obj_from_python`). YOU COULD JUST KNIT IT EVERY TIME YOU ANSWER A QUESTION, BUT IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT ON YOUR OWN RSTUDIO. UPDATING RSTUDIO ONLY TAKES A SECOND AND DOESN'T DELETE ANY PACKAGES, ETC. JUST GO TO https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download AND DOWNLOAD/RUN/RESTART AND YOU SHOULD BE ALL SET. REGARDLESS, I HAVE ADDED ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT (e.g., BY READING IN THE DATA FROM ONLINE OR FROM A CSV): STILL, I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLAY WITH RETICULATE! THE REMAINING HOMEWORKS WILL BE DONE USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS.

### Question 1: (2 pts)

##### The dataset `faithful` contains information about eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. The first few observations are listed below.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
#use_python("/usr/bin/python3") #uncomment if on the servers
faithful<-faithful
glimpse(faithful)
py_available()
py_config()
```

##### Bring the dataset `faithful` over from R and look at it in Python. THE REST OF THIS ASSIGNMENT MUST BE COMPLETED IN PYTHON UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED! What type of object is it? What are the minimum and maximum values of the variables eruptions and waiting? Put a dot after the object and hit tab: Look at all those functions!

```{python}
faithful=r.faithful 
#again, this may not work by running the chunk on the servers, but it should still knit.
#to read this into python directly, sidestepping the issue, just uncomment and run the following two lines
import py_compile
import pandas as pd
dlist = [1,2,3,4]
dlist
#faithful=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")
min(faithful["eruptions"])
max(faithful["eruptions"])
min(faithful["waiting"])
max(faithful["waiting"])
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

### Question 2: (4 pts)

##### Now, import `numpy` and use functions from it to compute the mean, median, and variance for each variable. Finally, compute the correlation between the two variables using corrcoef (it will return a matrix). You can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `.` operator (e.g., `faithful.eruptions`).

```{python}
import numpy as np

np.mean(faithful["eruptions"])
np.mean(faithful["waiting"])
np.median(faithful["eruptions"])
np.median(faithful["waiting"])
np.var(faithful["eruptions"])
np.var(faithful["waiting"])
np.corrcoef(faithful["eruptions"],faithful["waiting"])
# your code here
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

---

### Question 3: (6 pts)

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in python. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask python for the number of rows in the dataset where the variable `waiting` takes on values greater than 60. Then I ask for the average of the variable `eruptions` when the variable `waiting` is above 60.

```{python}
faithful[faithful.waiting>60].shape
faithful[faithful.waiting>60].eruptions.mean()
# or np.mean(faithful[faithful.waiting>60].eruptions)
```


##### 3.2 (1 pt) What is the standard deviation of the variable `eruptions`?

```{python}
np.std(faithful.eruptions)
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

##### 3.3 (2 pts) What is the standard deviation of the variable `eruptions` when `waiting` is *less than* the median? 

```{python}
faithful[faithful.waiting<(np.median(faithful.waiting))].eruptions.std()
np.std(faithful[faithful.waiting<(np.median(faithful.waiting))].eruptions)
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

##### 3.4 (2 pts) What is the standard deviation of the variable `eruptions` when `waiting` is *greater than* the median?

```{python}
faithful[faithful.waiting>(np.median(faithful.waiting))].eruptions.std()
np.std(faithful[faithful.waiting>(np.median(faithful.waiting))].eruptions)
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

### Question 4: (4 pts)

##### Both variables are measured in minutes. Create two new variables named `eruptions_h` and `waiting_h` that give each variable **in hours rather than minutes** and add them to the dataset `faithful`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates a new variable called eruptions_minus_one. Instead, computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{python}
faithful['eruptions_h']=(faithful['eruptions']/60)
faithful['waiting_h']=(faithful['eruptions']/60)
faithful.head()
```


### Question 5: (4 pts)

##### Let's make some plots in python!

##### 5.1 (1 pt) Create a boxplot of each original variable (eruptions and waiting) using the `boxplot()` function from matplotlib

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.boxplot(faithful['eruptions'])
plt.show()
```

```{python}
plt.boxplot(faithful['waiting'])
plt.show()
```

##### 5.2 (1 pt) Create a histogram of each original variable using the `hist()` function. 

```{python}
plt.hist(faithful.eruptions)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
plt.hist(faithful.waiting)
plt.show()
```

##### 5.3 (1 pt) Create a scatterplot by plotting both variables against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that plot takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. 

```{python}
#???????????????????????????????
plt.scatter(faithful.eruptions,faithful.waiting)
plt.show()
```

##### 6.1 (1 pt) Load the tips dataset from `seaborn` (a plotting package we will use later). Have a look at it below. What type of object is it?  

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
#pd.read_csv("http://www.justFYIyouCanReadDataFromURLs.com/myfile.csv")

tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris') #yep, that iris

tips.head()
tips.describe()

#using pandas groupby functionality
groups = tips.groupby('sex')
groups['tip'].mean()

#float64??????????????????????
#tips.to_csv("tips.csv") #create tips.csv file in case reticulate isn't working so you can read it into R
```

*your answer here, 1-2 sentences*

##### 6.2 (1 pt) Access tips using `py$df` in R and make a plot with ggplot illustrating the relationship between total_bill, tip, time, and sex (find an effective way to include all four variables in the same plot)!

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
tips<-py$tips
glimpse(tips)
ggplot(tips, aes(x=tip, total_bill)) +geom_point(aes(color=sex)) + facet_wrap(tips$time)
```


```{R, echo=F}
## DO NOT DELETE THIS BLOCK!
sessionInfo()
Sys.time()
Sys.info()
```
