Using Python to examine datasets (Basics)

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
faithful<-faithful
glimpse(faithful)
```
*R and python have many similar functions and are compatible with each other through an R markdown file! Here I will be looking into the faithful dataset and see how I can use functions from pandas.*
```{python}
faithful=r.faithful 
import py_compile
import pandas as pd
min(faithful["eruptions"])
max(faithful["eruptions"])
min(faithful["waiting"])
max(faithful["waiting"])
```
*Using the min and max functions, I can examine the lowest and highest values of the various variables within the faithful dataset! This is identical to the min and max functions of R!*
```{python}
import numpy as np

np.mean(faithful["eruptions"])
np.mean(faithful["waiting"])
np.median(faithful["eruptions"])
np.median(faithful["waiting"])
np.var(faithful["eruptions"])
np.var(faithful["waiting"])
np.corrcoef(faithful["eruptions"],faithful["waiting"])
```

*Through numpy, I can look at the mean, median, variance, and correllation coefficients of the variables of the faithful dataset. While you would use tidyverse and the summarize function to get these values, python has standalone functions through numpy! Python is very flexible for analyzing data!*
